    <h2>Electron Auto-Updater</h2>
    <p>
        A complete solution to package and build a ready for distribution Electron, Proton Native or Muon app for macOS, Windows and Linux with “auto update” support out of the box. See documentation on electron.build. NPM packages management: Native application
        dependencies compilation (including Yarn support). Development dependencies are never included. You don't need to ignore them explicitly. Two package.json structure is supported, but you are not forced to use it even if you have native production
        dependencies. Code Signing on a CI server or development machine. Auto Update ready application packaging.
